# Cargo Notes

- Cargo is Rust's build and package manager
- Use `--help` or `-h` if you need any help with Cargo's command-line utility:  `cargo -help`
- To create a new project with Cargo, use `cargo new` command: `cargo new hello_world`
  - Use `lib` if you're creating a library.
  - This creates a new git repository by default. Pass `--vcs none` if you don't want one.
- `Cargo.toml` folder contains package metadata
- `main.rs` is the entry point of a Rust application
- Use `cargo build` to build the package or program
  - This generates a new folder called `target` with an executable
- Use `cargo run` to run the executable
